                <ul>
                    <li>This base is not rushed <u><b>(like brandons)</b></u></li>
                    <li>There are six builders (which is the max)</li>
                    <li>All the defenses have been upgraded</li>
                    <li>All the stoarages, mines, and pumps are maxed</li>
                    <li>This base is actually active and participates in war <u><b>(unlike bman)</b></u></li>
                    <li>This base does its attacks</li>
                    <li>This base has a solid amount of resources saved up incase of another economic collapse like the great depression. <b>They do not trust banks, and store their money privately. With the rise of inflation and the corruption of the government this is the only way</b></li>
                    <li>This base even outsources builders contracts to the master builder from the builder base, because it is so economically strong and safe.</li>
                    <li>Solid amount of trophies for level</li>
