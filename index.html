                    <p>In Clash of Clans, you can design your base however you want. it can be as useful and good as you need, or it can be a meme that is rushed and does nto work well. the whole purpose of the base is to help defend against an enemy attack. This makes them important, as a bad base means an easy win for the enemy.</p>
                
                    <ul>
                        <li>This base is not rushed <u><strong>(like brandons)</strong></u></li>
                        <li>There are six builders (which is the max)</li>
                        <li>All the defenses have been upgraded</li>
                        <li>All the stoarages, mines, and pumps are maxed</li>
                        <li>This base is actually active and participates in war <u><strong>(unlike bman)</strong></u></li>
                        <li>This base does its attacks</li>
                        <li>This base has a solid amount of resources saved up incase of another economic collapse like the great depression. <strong>They do not trust banks, and store their money privately. With the rise of inflation and the corruption of the government this is the only way</strong></li>
                        <li>This base even outsources builders contracts to the master builder from the builder base, because it is so economically strong and safe.</li>
                        <li>Solid amount of trophies for level</li>
                    
                    
            <h2>The Builder Base</h2> 
            <h4>(Real in game footage from me btw)</h4>  
                    
                <img src="Builder%20Base%20Image.PNG" alt = "builder base on clash of clans" width = "550" height = "300">
                    
                    
                    <p><b>Overview:</b> The builder base is a fundamental part of the game that allows the player to start a brand new base. There are new troops, new buildings, and an all new builder.</p>
                    
                    <p><b> New feature:</b> In this new base, there is a new way to batle. There is not longer any base raiding, but rather a 1 on 1 versus battle. The winner is determined by whoever destroyes the most, and gets the highest percentage with the most stars.</p>
                    
                    <p><b> New builder:</b> Maxing out the townhall will allow you to build the Otto Hut. As you complete certain challenges, the Otto hut will upgrade. When it is maxed out, you will get a second builder for the island. However, this builder can also travel to the main base, allowing for 6 total builders. It is hard to max out the Otto hut, as you need to max a troop, gear up some buildings, and max the battle machine.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Issues:</b> This base has many issues, as it very tempting to spend money on, and it hurts families and students as a whole. It is like working a full time job, and you must put in 40 hours a week to ensure maximum potential and efficiency. Don't worry about taking care of your kids, just throw them aside. </p>
                        
                    <p><b>Solution:</b> A solution to this is to have other people spend money on the game, by black mailing them into doing so. Maybe threaten their kids, or find some dirt on the family, or maybe report them to the IRS for tax fraud. Remember, gems are everything</p>
